A Plugin for Composing Entities from other Entities
========================================

From release 4.4, the IoT Broker provides the *entity composer plugin* having the functionality to compose entities from other entities by means of aggregating attribute values and renaming attributes. This plugin is optional. If deployed, it extends the IoT Broker by a [Query Service](../doc/extensionpoint).
